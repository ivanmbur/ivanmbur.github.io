        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the following I will describe my research interests.

        <p>The standard model of particle physics has been extremely successful at describing the elementary constituents of the universe.
            However, we know it is incomplete.
            An excellent retelling of the standard model, its achievements, and its limitations, can be found in <a href = "https://youtu.be/zNVQfWC_evg?si=FQtx5sMKR_UUws2J" target = "_blank">this lecture by David Tong</a>.</p>

        <p>Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is one of the sectors of this standard model.
            It describes the nucleus of atoms, its constituents, and the ways in which they interact.
            One of the fundamental difficulties in probing the standard model, and thus uncovering its limitations, is that analytic handling of this sector is beyond the scope of our current mathematical methods.
            This is evidence of undiscovered truths about the framework in which we describe the standard model, quantum field theory (QFT).
            We must then resort to advance computational methods which allow us to directly tackle the problem and extract its predictions.</p>

        <p>Amongst these, lattice QCD has been the only systematically improvable method developed to directly probe QCD.
            In it we directly compute the path integral of a sibling of QCD, a statistical model known as Euclidean QCD.
            In order to do this we use Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods, which provides us with large ensembles of data.
            These have proven extremely useful in understanding the spectrum of QCD.
            A concrete example of this is the mass of the proton.
            Instead of being the simple sum of the masses of its constituent quarks, the mass of the proton is heavily dominated by the complex dynamics of the quark and gluon fields that it is made of.</p>

        <p>More recently, big efforts have been done trying to understand real-time processes.
            Amongst these, scattering is particularly important, for it is directly probed in collider experiments.
            Accessing this information from Euclidean QCD is notoriously difficult, for the quantum real-time fluctuations are replaced by thermal ones in equilibrium.
            I work in two methods that solve this problem.</p>
